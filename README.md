# HBOI BMFC Summer 2022
A continuation of Emerick Gilliams' project, [linked here](https://github.com/harborbranchreustudent/Harbor-Branch-Benthic-Microbial-Fuel-Cells---Emerick-Gilliams).  This project seeks to extend and complement the work done by Emerick.  The primary extension in this project is to provide the sensor system with a self-sustaining power source using the the Fuel Cells.  This system should allow for nearly indefinite periods of time, likely to be limited by health of the battery rather than simply the charge.  In addition, more information will be gathered on the performance and characteristics of the BMFC including polarization curves and power density curves.  The primary focus for the electronic and code design will be power efficiency and modularity.
## Electronics:
While still in development, the heart of the system will (likely) be a [Ti TPS61200](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps61201.pdf?ts=1654524777230&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.ti.com%252Fproduct%252FTPS61201) based DC-DC converter.  This device was choosen due to its low start-up voltage (and lower operational voltage) which complements the capabilities of the Fuel Cell well.  Another option would be based on the [LTC3108] (https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/LTC3108.pdf) however, with a max V<sub>in</sub> of 500 mV, the Fuel Cells we tested would have been incompatabile without more electrical components.  The rest of the the electronics consist of microcontroller and a [LiPo Charger](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15217)
